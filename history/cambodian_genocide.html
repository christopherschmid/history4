    <h2>More Details on the Cambodian Genocide (Khmer Rouge)</h2>
    <p><strong>Cause:</strong> The Cambodian Genocide was driven by the radical communist ideology of the Khmer Rouge, which wanted to change Cambodia into an agrarian, classless society. This involved the brutal extermination of certain enemies, including urban populations, intellectuals, and those associated with the former government.</p>
    <p><strong>Major Events:</strong> The Khmer Rouge forcibly evacuated urban areas, subjected people to forced labor, and implemented brutal policies that resulted in mass starvation and executions. The "killing fields" and prisons like Tuol Sleng (S-21) are well-known for the terrible acts committed against the Cambodian people.</p>
    <p><strong>Results:</strong> The Cambodian Genocide ended in the deaths of approximately 1.7 to 2.2 million people, a massive part of Cambodia's population at the time. The brutality of this genocide has left scars on the nation, and its effects are still felt today.</p>
