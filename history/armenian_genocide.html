    <h1>Armenian Genocide</h1>
    <p><strong>Name:</strong> Armenian Genocide</p>
    <p><strong>Place:</strong> Ottoman Empire (modern-day Turkey)</p>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> 1915-1923</p>
    <p><strong>Perpetrators:</strong> Ottoman government under the Young Turks</p>
    <p><strong>Victims:</strong> Armenian population, Assyrians, and other Christian minority groups</p>
    <h2>More Details:</h2>
    <p><strong>Cause:</strong> This Genocide was primarily driven by religious and ethnic tensions in the multi-ethnic Ottoman Empire. The ruling Young Turks, who were nationalists and wanted a homogeneous Turkish state, saw the Christian Armenian population as a threat and used World War I as a pretext to target and eliminate them.</p>
    <p><strong>Major Events:</strong> The mass killings started in 1915 with the removal and mass murder of Armenians from their homes. Many were subjected to forced labor, death marches, and outright massacres. The Armenian population was decimated during this period.</p>
    <p><strong>Results:</strong> An estimated 1.5 million Armenians and other Christian minorities were killed during the Armenian Genocide. The events of the Armenian Genocide are widely recognized as the first modern genocide, and the international community's response, or lack thereof, set a precedent for future genocides.</p>
